- This is the package documentation for the `Algpseudocodex` LaTeX package that we are going to be using as input for our project. This is important because LaTeX doesn't allow pseudocode typesetting by default, so we chose this package as it's an improvement over other algorithm type packages.

- This is the GitHub for the `Algpseudocodex` package, so we are able to check the repository for future updates/releases as well as referencing examples.

- This is an article about Pratt Parsing and how it works. This is important to our project because our parser for LaTeXPy is a pratt parser and being able to understand how it works for debugging purposes is essential, especially when we will have to create long abstract syntax trees for algorithms.
